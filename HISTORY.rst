Feb 18, 2019 (Proof-of-concept)
--------------------------------
An early proof-of-concept for object-detection on players (I _think_ this was some out-of-the-box YOLO setup from some tutorial - I remember being plesantly surprised by the drag-and-drop results)

Nov 14, 2018  (Proof-of-concept)
---------------------------------
Proof-of-concept an Xbox360 controller here, which requires plugging this into a PC and streaming the Xbox to the PC, which is a pain to get working and error prone.
