🕹 XCV uses 👾OpenCV for 🐍Python to 👷‍operate a ✨magic 🤖robot 🎮controller
\n\n
The project's goal is to make OpenCV experiments easier, by avoiding controller-driver 
nonsense and just hacking into controllers and connecting the buttons to an arduino/teensy/whatever. 
On the arduino/teensy side of things, we then just parse out the commands and send some high/low signals
to I/O pins (other bits and bobs to handle all the I/O) and then a fancy display output to make things more fancy.
